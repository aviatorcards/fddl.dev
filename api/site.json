      "rawMarkdown" : "\n# fddl Features and Capabilities\n\nfddl packs a surprising amount of functionality into a Swift-based static site generator; these features include shortcodes, plugins, the dev server, and the template system. A custom markdown processor (SwiftMark) is also included.\n\n## Shortcodes: Dynamic Content in Static Sites\n\nShortcodes let you embed rich content without writing HTML. fddl supports both modern and retro shortcodes. Think geocities, gopher, & gemini (not the AI)\n\n### Modern Shortcodes\n\nModern shortcodes are written in markdown and should be processed by SwiftMark. Sometimes they are simply going to be parsed as markdown, other times they are going to be processed as HTML, depending on the situation.\n\n#### YouTube Embeds\n\nEmbed videos with a simple shortcode:\n\n```markdown\n{{\\< youtube id=\"dQw4w9QgXcW\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" \\>}}\n```\n\n#### Alert Boxes\n\nCreate styled alert boxes for different message types:\n\n```markdown\n{{\\< alert type=\"info\" title=\"Did you know?\" \\>}}\nfddl has a complete plugin system!\n{{\\< \/alert \\>}}\n\n{{\\< alert type=\"success\" title=\"Build Status\" \\>}}\nYour site was generated successfully! 🎉\n{{\\< \/alert \\>}}\n\n{{\\< alert type=\"warning\" title=\"Remember\" \\>}}\nAlways backup your content before major changes.\n{{\\< \/alert \\>}}\n```\n\n#### Images with Captions\n\n```markdown\n{{\\< image src=\"\/assets\/images\/photo.jpg\" alt=\"Description\" caption=\"A beautiful sunset\" width=\"600\" \\>}}\n```\n\n### Retro GeoCities Shortcodes\n\nFor those who miss the 90s web, fddl includes nostalgic effects:\n\n```markdown\n{{\\< blink \\>}}🌟 UNDER CONSTRUCTION 🌟{{\\< \/blink \\>}}\n\n{{\\< marquee direction=\"left\" speed=\"normal\" \\>}}\nWelcome to my homepage!\n{{\\< \/marquee \\>}}\n\n{{\\< rainbow \\>}}Rainbow Text is BACK!{{\\< \/rainbow \\>}}\n\n{{\\< counter style=\"digital\" \\>}}\n```\n\nThese aren't just for fun—they demonstrate fddl's flexible shortcode system that you can extend with your own custom shortcodes.\n\n## Plugin System\n\nfddl's plugin architecture allows you to extend functionality without modifying core code.\n\n### Built-in Plugins\n\n#### Sitemap Generation\n\nAutomatically creates `sitemap.xml` for SEO:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<urlset xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.sitemaps.org\/schemas\/sitemap\/0.9\">\n  <url>\n    <loc>https:\/\/yoursite.com\/<\/loc>\n    <lastmod>2024-12-30<\/lastmod>\n  <\/url>\n<\/urlset>\n```\n\n#### RSS Feed\n\nGenerates an RSS 2.0 feed at `\/feed.xml` for blog posts:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<rss version=\"2.0\">\n  <channel>\n    <title>Your Blog<\/title>\n    <item>\n      <title>Latest Post<\/title>\n      <link>https:\/\/yoursite.com\/blog\/latest-post.html<\/link>\n    <\/item>\n  <\/channel>\n<\/rss>\n```\n\n#### Search Index\n\nBuilds a searchable JSON index of all content:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"pages\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Page Title\",\n      \"url\": \"\/page.html\",\n      \"content\": \"Searchable content...\",\n      \"tags\": [\"example\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Reading Time Estimator\n\nAutomatically calculates reading time for each page based on word count.\n\n### Creating Custom Plugins\n\nThe plugin system is designed to be extensible. Future versions will include a documented API for creating your own plugins.\n\n## Template System\n\nfddl uses a flexible YAML-based template system with multiple layouts.\n\n### Template Configuration\n\n```yaml\n# template.yml\nname: \"default\"\nversion: \"1.0\"\ndefaultLayout: \"page\"\noutputs:\n  - html\n```\n\n### Multiple Layouts\n\nDifferent content types can use different layouts:\n\n```yaml\n# html.yml\nlayouts:\n  page: \"views\/page.html\"\n  post: \"views\/post.html\"\n  index-list: \"views\/index-list.html\"\n```\n\n### Template Variables\n\nAccess page and site metadata in your templates:\n\n```html\n<h1>{{page.title}}<\/h1>\n<div class=\"content\">{{page.content}}<\/div>\n<p>Generated on {{site.generatedDate}}<\/p>\n<p>Build #{{site.buildID}}<\/p>\n```\n\nAvailable variables include:\n\n- `{{page.title}}` - Page title from frontmatter\n- `{{page.content}}` - Rendered HTML content\n- `{{page.description}}` - Page description\n- `{{page.date}}` - Publication date\n- `{{site.name}}` - Site name\n- `{{site.buildID}}` - Incremental build number\n- `{{site.generatedDate}}` - Generation timestamp\n\n## Development Server\n\nfddl includes a development server with hot reload capabilities (powered by SwiftNIO):\n\n```bash\nfddl serve --port 8080 --open\n```\n\nFeatures:\n\n- 🔥 **Hot Reload**: Changes appear instantly via WebSocket\n- 👀 **File Watching**: Automatically detects content changes\n- 🚀 **Instant Rebuilds**: Fast regeneration on save\n- 🌐 **Local Preview**: Test before deploying\n\n## Syntax Highlighting\n\nCode blocks are automatically highlighted using Splash:\n\n```swift\nstruct Person {\n    let name: String\n    var age: Int\n\n    func greet() {\n        print(\"Hello, my name is \\(name)!\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSupports multiple languages including Swift, JavaScript, Python, Bash, and more.\n\n## Asset Management\n\nfddl automatically handles static assets:\n\n```\ntemplates\/default\/assets\/\n├── css\/\n│   └── theme.css\n├── javascript\/\n│   └── theme.js\n└── images\/\n    └── logo.png\n```\n\nAll assets are copied to the output directory, maintaining the folder structure.\n\n## Build Tracking\n\nEvery site generation increments a build number, stored in `.fddl-build`:\n\n```\nBuild #42\n```\n\nThis helps track versions and can be displayed in your site footer.\n\n## Flexible Navigation\n\nNavigation is simple HTML in your templates—no complex configuration:\n\n```html\n<nav>\n  <a href=\"\/\">Home<\/a>\n  <a href=\"\/blog\/\">Blog<\/a>\n  <a href=\"\/about.html\">About<\/a>\n  <a href=\"\/projects\/\">Projects<\/a>\n<\/nav>\n```\n\nDifferent layouts can have different navigation menus.\n\n## What's Coming Next?\n\nFuture features on the roadmap:\n\n- API JSON output for headless CMS usage\n- Custom 404 error pages\n- macOS Services menu integration\n- Watch mode improvements\n- Theme marketplace\n- Plugin documentation and API\n\n## Try It Yourself\n\nThe best way to understand fddl's capabilities is to use it. Check out the [features demo](\/features-demo.html) page to see these features in action, or dive into the source code to see how they're implemented.\n\n> \"Features are only as good as their implementation.\" — fddl's guiding principle\n\n---\n\n**Built with fddl** - Where modern meets retro, and Swift meets markdown.\n",

      "rawMarkdown" : "\n# Swift-Powered Site Generation\n\nWhen most people think of Swift, they think of iOS apps. But Swift is a powerful, general-purpose language that excels at building developer tools, CLI applications, and—as fddl demonstrates—static site generators.\n\n## Why Swift for a Static Site Generator?\n\n### 1. Blazing Performance\n\nSwift is a compiled language with performance comparable to C++. For a static site generator that might process thousands of markdown files, this matters. While the difference might be negligible for a small blog, it becomes significant when generating large documentation sites or content-heavy projects.\n\n```swift\n\/\/ Swift's type system and compiler optimizations\n\/\/ make operations like this incredibly fast\nlet pages = try markdownFiles.map { file in\n    try processor.process(file)\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Type Safety and Reliability\n\nSwift's strong type system catches errors at compile time, not when your users are trying to build their sites. Optional handling, type inference, and Swift's emphasis on safety mean fewer runtime crashes and more predictable behavior.\n\n```swift\nstruct Page {\n    let title: String\n    let content: String\n    let metadata: [String: Any]?  \/\/ Optional, safely handled\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Modern Language Features\n\nSwift brings modern programming paradigms to systems-level performance:\n\n- **Optionals**: No more null pointer exceptions\n- **Generics**: Write reusable, type-safe code\n- **Protocol-Oriented Programming**: Flexible, composable architectures\n- **Value Types**: Safer concurrent code with structs\n- **Error Handling**: Explicit, type-safe error propagation\n\n### 4. Excellent Tooling\n\nThe Swift Package Manager makes dependency management straightforward. No separate build tools, no complex configuration—just a clean `Package.swift` file.\n\n## The Dependencies That Power fddl\n\nfddl stands on the shoulders of excellent Swift packages:\n\n### ArgumentParser\n\nApple's `swift-argument-parser` makes building CLI tools a breeze:\n\n```swift\nimport ArgumentParser\n\nstruct Generate: ParsableCommand {\n    @Flag(help: \"Enable verbose output\")\n    var verbose = false\n\n    func run() throws {\n        \/\/ Your generation logic here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nClean, declarative, and type-safe command-line interfaces with automatic help generation.\n\n### Yams\n\nYAML parsing for frontmatter and configuration files:\n\n```swift\nimport Yams\n\nlet frontmatter = try Yams.load(yaml: yamlString)\n```\n\nEssential for reading the metadata in markdown files and template configurations.\n\n### swift-markdown\n\nApple's official markdown parser provides robust, standards-compliant markdown processing:\n\n```swift\nimport Markdown\n\nlet document = Document(parsing: markdownContent)\n\/\/ Process and transform the markdown AST\n```\n\nThis gives fddl fine-grained control over markdown rendering and enables custom transformations.\n\n### Splash\n\nSyntax highlighting for code blocks, created by John Sundell:\n\n```swift\nimport Splash\n\nlet highlighter = SyntaxHighlighter(format: HTMLOutputFormat())\nlet html = highlighter.highlight(code)\n```\n\nThis is what makes code examples in fddl-generated sites look beautiful.\n\n### SwiftNIO\n\nFor the development server with hot reload capabilities:\n\n```swift\nimport NIOCore\nimport NIOHTTP1\nimport NIOWebSocket\n\n\/\/ Build a high-performance HTTP server with WebSocket support\n```\n\nSwiftNIO provides the foundation for fddl's dev server, enabling features like live reload and file watching.\n\n## The Architecture\n\nfddl is organized into focused modules:\n\n- **Commands**: CLI command implementations\n- **Core**: Site generation engine\n- **Markdown**: Markdown processing and shortcode handling\n- **Templates**: Template rendering system\n- **Plugins**: Extensible plugin architecture\n- **DevServer**: Development server with hot reload\n- **FileSystem**: File operations and asset management\n\nEach module has a clear responsibility, making the codebase maintainable and extensible.\n\n## Performance in Practice\n\nThanks to Swift's performance characteristics, fddl can:\n\n- Generate thousands of pages in milliseconds - probably. I haven't actually tested this.\n- Process markdown with minimal overhead\n- Handle concurrent file operations safely\n- Serve development previews with low latency\n\n## The Swift Ecosystem Advantage\n\nBy choosing Swift, fddl benefits from:\n\n- **Active Development**: Swift continues to evolve with new features\n- **Strong Community**: Growing beyond just iOS development\n- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and (experimentally) Windows\n- **Professional Tooling**: Xcode, LSP support, excellent debugging\n\n> \"Swift is not just for apps. It's for anything you want to build.\" — The fddl philosophy\n\n---\n\n**Built with fddl** - Powered by Swift, driven by curiosity.\n",

But Swift is a powerful, general-purpose language that excels at building developer tools, CLI applications, and—as fddl demonstrates—static site generators.<\/p>\n<h2>Why Swift for a Static Site Generator?<\/h2>\n<h3>1. Blazing Performance<\/h3>\n<p>Swift is a compiled language with performance comparable to C++. For a static site generator that might process thousands of markdown files, this matters. While the difference might be negligible for a small blog, it becomes significant when generating large documentation sites or content-heavy projects.<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-swift\"><span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">\/\/<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">Swift&#39;s<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">type<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">system<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">and<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">compiler<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">optimizations<\/span>\n<span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">\/\/<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">make<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">operations<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">like<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">this<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">incredibly<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">fast<\/span>\n<span style=\"color: #c586c0;\">let<\/span> pages = <span style=\"color: #c586c0;\">try<\/span> markdownFiles.<span style=\"color: #dcdcaa;\">map<\/span> { file <span style=\"color: #c586c0;\">in<\/span>\n    <span style=\"color: #c586c0;\">try<\/span> processor.<span style=\"color: #dcdcaa;\">process<\/span>(file)\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>2. Type Safety and Reliability<\/h3>\n<p>Swift’s strong type system catches errors at compile time, not when your users are trying to build their sites. Optional handling, type inference, and Swift’s emphasis on safety mean fewer runtime crashes and more predictable behavior.<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-swift\"><span style=\"color: #c586c0;\">struct<\/span> Page {\n    <span style=\"color: #c586c0;\">let<\/span> title: <span style=\"color: #4ec9b0;\">String<\/span>\n    <span style=\"color: #c586c0;\">let<\/span> content: <span style=\"color: #4ec9b0;\">String<\/span>\n    <span style=\"color: #c586c0;\">let<\/span> metadata: [<span style=\"color: #4ec9b0;\">String<\/span>: <span style=\"color: #4ec9b0;\">Any<\/span>]?  <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">\/\/<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">Optional,<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">safely<\/span> <span style=\"color: #6a9955;\">handled<\/span>\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>3.
