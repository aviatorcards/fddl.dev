This project represents both a functional tool and a learning journey—built in conjunction with NotebookLM to explore Swift development.\n\n## What is fddl?\n\nfddl is a static site generator that transforms markdown files into beautiful, fast-loading HTML websites. It's designed for anyone who wants to publish content without the overhead of a database, server-side rendering, or complex deployment pipelines.\n\n### Perfect For\n\n- **Personal blogs** - Share your thoughts and ideas\n- **Project documentation** - Keep your docs alongside your code\n- **Portfolio sites** - Showcase your work professionally\n- **Family sites** - Share photos and stories with loved ones\n- **Knowledge bases** - Build your personal wiki or codebase with rookery (Rookery is a Swift-based web application for managing code snippets)\n- **Countless other uses** - fddl is a static site generator, so it can be used for any static site generation task\n\n## Why Another Static Site Generator?\n\nGreat question! fddl was born from a desire to learn Swift while building something practical. By working with NotebookLM as a learning companion, this project explores Swift's capabilities beyond iOS development—specifically in the realm of developer tooling.\n\nThe result is a fast, type-safe static site generator that leverages Swift's modern features:\n\n- **Performance**: Swift's compiled nature means blazing-fast site generation\n- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time, not runtime\n- **Modern Syntax**: Clean, readable code that's a joy to work with\n- **Rich Ecosystem**: Built on solid Swift packages like ArgumentParser and swift-markdown\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGetting up and running with fddl is straightforward:\n\n```bash\n# Build from source\nswift build -c release\ncp .build\/release\/fddl \/usr\/local\/bin\/\n\n# Generate your site\nfddl generate\n\n# Check version\nfddl version\n```\n\nYour content lives in the `contents\/` directory as markdown files with YAML frontmatter:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"My First Post\"\ndescription: \"Getting started with fddl\"\nlayout: post\ntags: [\"example\"]\n---\n\n# Hello World\n\nYour content goes here!\n```\n\n## What Makes fddl Special?\n\nWhile fddl is still evolving (it's not production-ready yet!), it already includes some compelling features:\n\n- **Markdown Processing** with YAML frontmatter support\n- **Shortcodes** for dynamic content (YouTube embeds, alerts, even retro GeoCities effects!)\n- **Template System** with flexible layouts\n- **Plugin Architecture** for extending functionality\n- **Build Tracking** to version your site generations\n- **Dev Server** with hot reload (coming soon!)\n\n## The Learning Journey\n\nThis project is openly a learning experience. It's not perfect, and it's not trying to compete with established tools like Hugo or Jekyll. Instead, it's a playground for exploring Swift's capabilities in a different context.\n\nIf you're interested in Swift beyond iOS, or if you're curious about building developer tools, fddl's source code might be worth exploring. It demonstrates practical applications of:\n\n- Command-line argument parsing\n- File system operations\n- Template rendering\n- Markdown processing\n- Plugin architectures\n\n## What's Next?\n\nIn upcoming posts, we'll dive deeper into:\n\n- The technical architecture and Swift dependencies\n- Feature showcases with live examples\n- Customization and theming\n- Building your own plugins\n\n> \"The best way to learn is by doing.\" — Someone wise, probably\n\nReady to explore more?
