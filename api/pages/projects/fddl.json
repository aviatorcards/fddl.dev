It's the engine powering this very website.\n\n## Why build another SSG?\n\nWhile there are many excellent static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, and Astro, I wanted something that combined:\n\n1.  **Swift Power**: Leveraging the speed and type safety of Swift for the build engine.\n2.  **Custom Markdown**: A processor (SwiftMark) that I can extend with custom shortcodes and syntax.\n3.  **Minimalist Templates**: A simple YAML-based configuration that stays out of the way.\n4.  **Learning**: Building it was a way to dive deep into Swift's string processing, file system APIs, and CLI argument parsing.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **[SwiftMark](\/projects\/swiftmark.html)**: A custom Markdown engine with real-time, high-fidelity rendering.\n- **Shortcode System**: Easily embed YouTube videos, info alerts, and even retro Geocities-style effects.\n- **Plugin Architecture**: Support for automated sitemaps, RSS feeds, and search indexing.\n- **Flexible Navigation**: Navigation menus defined in simple YAML configs.\n- **Themes**: Support for multiple look-and-feel options, from \"Brutalist\" to \"Glassmorphism.\"\n\n## How it works\n\nThe generator scans your `contents\/` directory for Markdown files, processes the frontmatter, and applies your chosen template. It then copies all assets (CSS, JS, Images) to the `output\/` folder.\n\n```bash\n# Generate the site\nfddl generate\n\n# Preview with live-reload\nfddl serve\n```\n\nThe resulting `output` folder is purely static—it can be hosted anywhere with zero server-side requirements.\n",
